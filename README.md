# 📝 Product Review Case Studies (NLP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two Natural Language Processing (NLP) **mini case studies** focused on analyzing product reviews.  
The goal is to understand how customers express feedback, classify sentiments, and extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.  

Both case studies use **real-world product review datasets** and demonstrate the **end-to-end NLP pipeline**, from data preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **text cleaning and preprocessing** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand word frequency, sentiment distribution, and review length patterns.
- Apply **feature extraction** techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.
- Build **machine learning models** for:
  - Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
  - Rating prediction (numerical values)
- Visualize results using word clouds, bar plots, and confusion matrices.
- Compare different approaches across **Case Study 1** and **Case Study 2**.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset `Product_Reviews.csv` contains:
- **Review Text** – Customer’s written feedback
- **Rating** – Numerical rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)
- **Additional Features** – May include review title, product category, etc.

📊 The dataset is used for both **Case Study 1** and **Case Study 2** with different modeling approaches.

📊 Case Studies
🔹 Case Study 1

Focused on basic preprocessing and classical ML models.

Uses Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF for feature extraction.

Trains models like Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest.

Evaluates performance with standard metrics.

🔹 Case Study 2

Extends Case Study 1 with advanced NLP techniques.

Explores word embeddings (Word2Vec / GloVe).

May include deep learning architectures (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers).

Provides richer comparison and deeper insights.

📈 Sample Visualizations

Some of the insights generated:

Word Cloud of frequent positive & negative terms.

Distribution of Ratings across products.

Confusion Matrix showing classification performance.

Sentiment Polarity Plots (if applied using TextBlob / VADER).

🔮 Future Enhancements

Incorporate transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better accuracy.

Deploy the model as a Flask/Django API or a Streamlit dashboard.

Extend dataset with multilingual product reviews.

Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis (e.g., quality, delivery, packaging).
